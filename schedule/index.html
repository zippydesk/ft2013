We have a jungle of browsers out there, between desktop, mobile, tablets, tv's etc. Different flavors with the same pain in the end. I will show a simple approach to log your JS errors, adding stack trace information for them using stacktrace.js. 
On top of this solution, a simple charting and logging that you can use for, per example, monitoring rollouts of your app.</p></div>

As more users visit our sites with mobile devices, latency, bandwidth, and CPU capabilities create new, greater challenges. In this session we'll cover common trouble spots that lead to these poor user experiences as well as tips and techniques to prevent these trouble spots from arising including images, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, DOM, memory management and tools.</p></div>

                    </header>
<div class="talk-description"><p>Yandex' web platform for creating our sites has been developed over many years, with a lot of thinking about the difference between code that helps authors write, and code that runs efficiently in browsers. Now, in <a href="http://bem.info">BEM project</a> we are open-sourcing the full stack of technologies behind our in-house UI framework. It takes the approach of building interface components, rather than separating the HTML, CSS and Javascript development. This simplifies the task of composing pages of services. By using declarative coding style to aid human authors, and tools to transform this to code that runs efficiently in the browser, we have simple ways to express complexity, so we produce code that is both efficient to maintain and runs well in the browser.</p>
<p>This talk gives a birds-eye view of the sometimes surprising ideas behind BEM, and the benefits they offer developers.</p></div>

<div class="talk-description"><p>Right, we've got a new project, we have to calculate and draw 500,000 pixels, and the deadline is in 1.667 milliseconds. When we're done, we'll do it again, and again. Web performance has always been about delivering those pixels on time, but the target has shifted. Optimising pure JavaScript (loops, string concatenation, arithmetic) is more irrelevant than ever, performance gains are to be found in the DOM, layout dependencies, and the interaction with the GPU.</p>
<p>We'll look at a series of real-world rendering issues and how to combat them, understanding why particular hacks work, and how sometimes working against the browser can trick it into performing better. Covering basic html layout and animation, GPU interaction and high-dpi (retina) considerations across browsers and devices.</p></div>

And why is that important to know whether you’re a front-end developer or a business owner? This talk will explore the business side of front-end technologies: responsive vs. “fixed” vs. mobile, tablet and/or desktop; when to use the fancy new and shiny, when not to; and lastly, why even when you make free open-source software, you should still know and learn more about selling your software to people.</p></div>

<div class="talk-description"><p>border-radius is humble. It will never show off. Everyone and their cat think they know it well, but it won’t stand up to defend itself. Instead, it will smirk quietly while everybody is busy paying attention to its more flashy siblings, confident in its own skin. border-radius might seem superficially simple, but it can be very powerful. However, its powers are reserved only for those who know how to unleash them. Under its superficial simplicity it hides some of the most complex algorithms in CSS. Intrigued?

<div class="talk-description"><p>In the past year something one might call "Backend as a Service" has been popping up all over the place. The promise is: You can focus on building what's unique to your apps, the frontend. The "boring stuff", like user authentication, data storage, payments, you name it – that's already there.</p>

<p>It empowers frontend developers to build fully distributed, data driven apps without having to set up and maintain a backend.</p>

<p>Examples are <a href="http://parse.com/">parse.com</a>, <a href="http://deployd.com/">deployd.com</a>, <a href="http://simperium.com/">simperium.com</a> and a couple of others. They differ in their approach, but they all go in roughly the same direction. I'll explain what the overall idea means to frontend developers and compare the different approaches that are currently available. I'll also live demo an open source solution we worked on lately: Hoodie.</p></div>

In product design, the trend has been towards more; faster.

One that takes an opposite approach and champions slowing down, choice and craft.</p>

<p>With seven years of learnings from designing for online music, Hannah will describe techniques for questioning the status quo in product design; how and when taking an opposite approach might be beneficial; and why having a sharply tuned radar for style and trends is just as important for product design as being observant of what we want.</p></div>

                    </header>
<div class="talk-description"><p>The web is growing fast. Every other week new proposals, specifications and implementations pop up - being developed concurrently. It is getting harder and harder for developers to grasp specification and implementation details across the various rendering engines.</p>

<p>We'll be discussing how developers can familiarize themselves with a new topic and thereby find browser bugs and shortcomings in specifications as well as how they can provide invaluable information to the web development community by doing this and thus, help the web move forward.</p></div>

<div class="talk-description"><p>When you are a developer you sometimes struggle to understand what designers are asking you for. As a designer you ask yourself why developers cannot just do what you expect. To deliver good work it is important to understand each other. On this foundation a lot of problems can be avoided in advance. Enter the world of style guides and see how they can improve this cooperation.</p></div>

                    </header>
<div class="talk-description"><p>Authentication is hard. Users verify their email address on every new site they visit and use the same four weak passwords everywhere. Site operators, even those with vast resources, find it difficult to properly secure their authentication systems.</p>

<p>Third party authentication was supposed to be a panacea, but has problems of its own: identifiers that nobody understands, difficult integration paths, and a limited selection of identity providers that have a vested interest in monetizing every login.</p>

<p>Persona is a decentralized and privacy protecting login system from Mozilla, using open standard designed to be built into browsers. Even though Persona is from Mozilla, it works in all modern browsers today.</p>

<p>Material covered:</p>

<ul><li>The authentication landscape today</li>
<li>What Persona is & the problem it is trying to solve</li>
<li>How Persona works</li>
<li>How Persona can be integrated into a site</li></ul></div>
